My main ETH dev address is: 0xEE18c8B4AD22f2b482059Cd6217d7036C5479447.
the Magic Dice game contract is deployed to Polygon Mubai test net at: 0x50B72e5400b1Fa93b3BcCee23Ccf8451F3Ba91BE. It should also be fully functional but the ABI or front end is needed to interact with the contract. My "GGLounge" page currently has the front end here: https://tangerine-gnome-1deaea.netlify.app/dice. Note this contract isn't yet made to scale as only one roll can be in play at a time.
